# Image to cbr creator
## What is a *cbr* file

A cbr file is actually a zip file where the extension is *.cbr* instead of *.zip*.
A cbr file is used with comic book viewers instead of having to view each image
individualy.

## How it works

The scripts accepts the absolute path of the folder containing the images. It will
rename all the files to 3 digits with 0 as placeholders. After that is done, it will
zip those files to the same name as the folder and place it in the parent folder.

## Example

There are 2 options for the script, *single* or *multiple* folders. The single folder
option will only zip a single folder's contents while the multiple folder option
will loop through multiple folders and zip their respective contents.

### Sinlge folder option

eg `python3 creator.py -s ~/Documents/1`
or
`python3 creator.py --single ~/Documents/1`

It requires that the folder name containing the images is a number and that the
images are numbers as well.

>*1*
>>*-1.jpg*
>>*-2.jpg*
>>*...*

### Multiple folder option

eg `python3 creator.py -m ~/Documents/1-20`
or
`python3 creator.py --multiple ~/Documents/1-20`

It requires that the parent folder name containing subfolders with the images is the
lowest value folder name *-* the highest value folder name and the subfolders have the
same requirements as the single folder option
eg *1-20* when the folders contains the folders *1* to and including *20*

>*1-20*
>>*1*
>>>*1.jpg*
>>>*2.jpg*
>>>*...*
>>
>>*2*
>>>*1.jpg*
>>>*2.jpg*
>>>*...*
>>
>>*...*

### Output

Once executed it will display the full filepath of the folder being zipped and will either
display *Single folder zipped successfully!* or *Multiple folders zipped successfully!*
depending on the option chosen once finished

## NOTE
This script requires python3
